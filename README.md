♦ Linear Search:
In linear search, we will find the position of two elements that sum to a taget present in array linearly..
➞ Iterate through each element in the list using an outer loop.
➞ For each element in the outer loop,use an inner loop to check every other element that comes after it.
➞ If a pair of numbers adds up to target,return their indices or values.
𝔗𝔦𝔪𝔢 ℭ𝔬𝔪𝔭𝔩𝔢𝔵𝔦𝔱𝔶:This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2),as each element is compared with every other element.

♦ Binary Search:
