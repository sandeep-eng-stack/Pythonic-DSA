♦Linear Search:
In linear search, we will find the position of a element present in array linearly..
➞ Starting from the beginning of the list,check each element one at a time.
➞ If the current element matches the target value,return the index of the target.
➞ If it reaches the end of the array without finding the target, it returns a failure message.
𝔗𝔦𝔪𝔢 ℭ𝔬𝔪𝔭𝔩𝔢𝔵𝔦𝔱𝔶:Linear search has a time complexity of O(n),where n is the number of elements in the list.This is because,in the worst case,it might have to check every element once(if the target is at the end or not present)
